## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#333333) to provide a sophisticated, developer-focused aesthetic.
- Primary color: Electric purple (#800080) for highlights and call-to-action elements to represent creativity and coding energy.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) to bring a technological feel, for interactive elements and links, creating visual interest against the dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its clean readability and modern, machined aesthetic, making it an excellent choice for both headings and body text in a portfolio setting.
